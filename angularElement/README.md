# AngularElemen

nvm version: 8.9.3
npm install -g @angular/cli@6

inside LPL : ng new angularElement

But you not required this step, so firstly you need to install the node here.
And run this npm run build:elements

to test this angular 6, go to the elements => npm install -g live-server && live-server

After that, copy and pasted the native-shim.js and framework-poll.js to shell/src/assets/js
